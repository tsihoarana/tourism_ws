### Install the Dependencies

From the project folder, install the dependencies:

    npm i

### Start the Server

    npm start

This will launch the Node server on port 3900. If that port is busy, you can set a different point in config/default.json.

### (Optional) Environment Variables

If you look at config/default.json, you'll see a property called jwtPrivateKey. This key is used to encrypt JSON web tokens. So, for security reasons, it should not be checked into the source control. I've set a default value here to make it easier for you to get up and running with this project. For a production scenario, you should store this key as an environment variable.

On Mac:

    export garage_jwtPrivateKey=yourSecureKey

On Windows:

    set garage_jwtPrivateKey=yourSecureKey
